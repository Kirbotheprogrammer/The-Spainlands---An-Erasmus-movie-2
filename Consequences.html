: after all, the reference comes from there. As I write these lines, I don’t know how things will turn out… or maybe I do, depending on what your imagination decides.<br><br>

Don’t get me wrong: I’m not thinking negatively. I’m genuinely excited for what’s coming from tomorrow onward, yet I can’t help but wonder if there will be aspects that I currently consider irrelevant, but my future self already knows and maybe regrets.<br><br>

Perhaps I should clarify what I mean by unforeseen consequences: they are almost never negative. They are reflections, small rhetorical details. Writing an apparently futile page before everything begins might seem pointless, but the idea of being able to read it again in a few months and smile, and maybe even realize I was right,feels really good.<br><br>
