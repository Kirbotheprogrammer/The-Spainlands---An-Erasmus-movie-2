When it comes to looking back, I always do it with a certain detachment: I’m always inclined toward change, never to go back.<br>
Thinking that only seven months separate An Erasmus Movie 2 from An Erasmus Movie fills me with a particular tenderness.<br><br>

How much can a person improve in such a short time? It’s almost inhuman: human beings can adapt in surprising ways, without any real trigger, thanks to what we call creativity.<br><br>

Many ask me how I manage to be both creative and cynical at the same time.<br>
My answer is simple: dare and isolate yourself.<br>
Allow your mind to find itself in desolate situations, where the only thing possible is to let imagination run free.<br><br>

Many of the scenes were born this way, from boldness.<br>
I never feared that someone might judge them inappropriate, because, as Verdi said in the opera

  <u><i>Falstaff:</i></u>
  <span class="tooltip-text" role="tooltip">
Falstaff is an italian opera by Giuseppe Verdi, based on Shakespeare’s The Merry Wives of Windsor and scenes from Henry IV. Premiered in 1893, it is Verdi’s final opera and is celebrated for its comedic brilliance, lively ensemble writing, and rich characterizations.

  <u><i>"Tutto nel mondo è burla"</i></u>

<br><br>

My sincerest advice is this: dare, imagine, isolate yourself, and keep moving forward.<br>
Don’t fear being limited by others: creativity is the only weapon that truly makes us human.<br><br>

Nowadays, this audacity is what distinguishes artificial intelligence from humans.<br>
A task can be executed flawlessly by A.I., but it will always be monotonous, gray, lifeless.<br><br>

I often found myself joking between clips: “Can A.I. ever do this?”<br>
The answer, of course, is no.<br>
Artificial intelligence will never reach these levels: it doesn’t dare, it doesn’t imagine, it simply copies what others have created.<br><br>

Do not be afraid to draw inspiration from existing material.<br>
Every artist starts by copying, and then develops their own style.<br>

Here’s the secret: none of them simply copied.<br>
Each nurtured their own creativity, and today they are considered masters of Japanese art, the same art I follow with passion.<br><br>

In conclusion, revisiting a great classic is never a mistake.<br>
These are the seeds left by a young artist that allow flourishing growth.<br>
Sometimes, perhaps, it’s even better that way.
