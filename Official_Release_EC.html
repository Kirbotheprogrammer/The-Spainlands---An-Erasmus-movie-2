Alas, unlike other times, I don’t have much to say, but I will guide you step by step behind the scenes.<br><br>

Let’s start with the naming of the An Erasmus Movie films.<br><br>

The number is NOT random: it literally indicates the number of the film I worked on. If another film is made in the future, I would call it An Erasmus Movie 3, regardless of anything else.<br><br>

For me, what really matters is the second title:<br>

  <u><i>Erasmus Crusaders…</i></u>
  <span class="tooltip-text" role="tooltip">
"Erasmus Crusaders” is a playful reference to “Stardust Crusaders,” the third part of the manga/anime JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure by Hirohiko Araki.

<br>
The SpainLands…<br><br>

When I talk about The SpainLands, I’m referring to An Erasmus Movie 2, and vice versa.<br><br>

The only exception would be a possible The SpainLands 2, which would indicate additional content: in that case, the movie number would remain unchanged.<br>
For example, if there were a The SpainLands 9, it would still be An Erasmus Movie 2.<br><br>

You can think of An Erasmus Movie 2 as a full-fledged universe, and The SpainLands as its chapters. I know it may seem complicated: that’s why we created the website.<br><br>

As for the interviews in the video… did you know they were chosen at random, while we were in the car? Funny, right? This connects to what I wrote in 

<span class="tooltip-container" tabindex="0" aria-label="Info GMTK 2025">
  <u><i>“Revisiting a Great Classic.”</i></u>
  <span class="tooltip-text" role="tooltip">
I believe looking back with detachment helps me grow creatively while embracing change. True creativity comes from daring, isolating myself, and drawing inspiration from others. Unlike A.I., I can imagine and take risks. Revisiting classics isn’t copying, it’s planting seeds for my own growth.
