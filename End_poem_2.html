In many Japanese works, the author concludes with an afterword: a few pages in which they reflect, express doubts about the future, and explain the bond with what they have created. It is never a “minor” message, but an integral part of the work itself. For me, these are those final pages.<br>
Every day we are exposed to countless stimuli: colors, sounds, ideas… Yet sometimes, we feel small, like grains of sand, or perhaps even smaller.<br>
To express how I felt with this video, I think of

  <u><i>Skies Forever Blue</i></u>
  <span class="tooltip-text" role="tooltip">
"Skies Forever Blue", created by Toby Fox and Itoki Hana, is a reflective and uplifting song about hope, perseverance, and renewal, blending introspective lyrics with imagery of open skies and a dreamy, optimistic musical atmosphere.

: what nourishes us, what makes us live, are our memories. Nothing truly ends as long as the memory of something remains alive. Even the most distant event dies when we forget it. We write, we tell stories, we make videos to not forget; for me, creativity is born from this field of memory, more than from economic or professional motivations.<br>
Perhaps this is why I made the first video: to remember. Memory is a sweet recollection that allows us to relive precious moments.<br><br>

However, be careful: memory and nostalgia are not the same thing. Nostalgia is something I have always detested: it is our enemy. While memory preserves a beautiful recollection, nostalgia inflates expectations, making us wish to relive what has already passed. I hate nostalgia: it pretends to be a friend, but it is ready to stab us in the back.<br>
Nostalgia creates what I call “false editing”: the incessant urge to modify something because it is not authentic, because it blinds us. It makes us think:<br>
<span id="Nostalgia"> 
<br><em>“Should I have said it this way?”</em><br>
 <em>“No, I should do it like this instead”</em><br>
 <em>“And now, what do I do?”</em>
 </span>
 <br><br>
Memory, on the other hand, is like a sweet little girl: whatever she says, she would never betray you. She protects you, pats you on the shoulder, and says:<br>
 <br>
    
    <span id="Memory"><em>“I’m sure you can wait for another moment to say this.”</em></span><br><br>

I also hate nostalgia because it makes us regret our own progress: 


<span id="Nostalgia"> 
<br><br><em>“Oh… how I wish I were still naive.”</em>
</span>
<br><br> But we cannot escape nostalgia: we will always fall for it, one way or another.<br>
For me, videos are a stimulus for reflection. They have the power to pull words out of my mouth and push me to share something new.<br><br>

Returning to the initial metaphor of nostalgia and memory: video games do not end when we finish them, but when we forget them. Memory keeps them alive, regardless of how good or bad they were. There is no bad memory that we want to remember; this, for me, is Memory.<br>
Nostalgia, on the other hand, blinds us and generates regret. It makes us chase false or incomplete memories and creates the expectation of a future we must absolutely remember. Memory cannot be sold, invented, or imagined. Nostalgia, however, tries to recreate itself: it can be sold, invented, and imagined.<br><br>

Think about TV series, movies, or video games: how many try to relive that unforgettable first time? Everyone.

  <u><i>Pokémon</i></u>
  <span class="tooltip-text" role="tooltip">
In general, the controversy around Pokémon’s use of nostalgia stems from the series often leveraging fans’ memories to sell games and content, sometimes at the expense of innovation. Frequent remakes, forced fan service, and artificial limitations on Pokémon availability are seen as marketing strategies that rely more on players’ emotional attachment than on delivering genuinely new experiences. This approach has sparked debate among fans, with some appreciating the nods to classic titles and others criticizing the lack of originality.

for example, built an empire on nostalgia. Nostalgia also fuels FOMO, the fear of missing an unrepeatable moment, generated by our brain.<br>
This is why today I prefer single-player games: I don’t have to live with the thought of having missed an opportunity or having to perfectly replicate an experience. In a blind playthrough, for example, the term itself implies the pressure of “not making mistakes,” because the experience must be unique.<br><br>

FOMO, this mechanism that dominates the 21st century, is everywhere: think of a streamer playing live. Immediately, our brain pushes us to drop everything and join in, before it’s “too late”… but not for us, for someone else. In 2025, it only takes a moment for something to become old, outdated, useless… to be forgotten.<br>
But can we really classify something as “not to be remembered”? Perhaps we are trying to create a memory, going against our own nature. Humans have never tried to create memories, but to live them. Yet today, we find ourselves doing exactly the opposite.<br><br>

Maybe it’s because I play older games and watch media considered “old memories” that I appreciate what I do. I am not afraid to invest time in something 40 or 45 years old, without it being fashionable. Fashion itself is an attempt to create a bond: either you are trendy, or you are not. But then, does it make sense to live like that?<br>
Instead, I choose to remember what I didn’t do because I was busy creating a memory I would want to preserve as an adult. Perhaps this is the real trap.<br><br>

I speak this way because I have fallen for it too many times, sleepless nights wondering if I would remember… but the solution is simple: you cannot create memories; you cannot force yourself to remember something you want to remember, because you will never truly recall what you have lived. I remember authentic moments much more than moments artificially created to make a memory.<br><br>

I am a guy like you, I am not invincible to these mechanisms; I fall for them like everyone else, and I hate them, because they hit me every time when I least expect it… and it really hurts.<br>
Who really values memory? No one. Memory cannot be sold: how can you sell a memory that is dear to you, but irrelevant to someone else? <i>An Erasmus Movie</i> does not aim to sell nostalgia, but to give space for the mind to remember, not to recollect.<br><br>

I may seem overly emotional or reflective, but I want to close with the final line of the song:<br>
 “In reality, I said finally, I love you…”<br>
It may seem confusing, but I find it poetic. After years in which nostalgia has dominated, the protagonist finally takes control, living the moment for what it is, without creating a new memory to regret. Perhaps, in this, I see myself: I am trying to escape these mechanisms once and for all.<br><br>

Now, all that’s left is to leave for Spain and see what will happen. In the meantime, I prepare for tomorrow like any other day, without trying to create a moment to share, but a moment for myself.
